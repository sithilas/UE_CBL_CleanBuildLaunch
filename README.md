# UE Clean Build Launch (UE CBL)
UE Clean Build Launch (UE CBL) is a Windows batch script that simplifies the process of cleaning, building, and launching Unreal Engine C++ projects. This tool is only compatible with projects using the binary (Epic Games Launcher) version of Unreal Engine ‚Äî it does not support source builds from GitHub.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Use at your own risk ‚Äî the author is not responsible for any lost or damaged files.
Before running this script, make sure you have committed all your changes to source control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
* Automatic Project Detection: Automatically finds the .uproject file in the current directory.
 
* Engine Version Resolution: Reads the EngineAssociation property from the .uproject file to determine the correct Unreal Engine version.
 
* Engine Installation Lookup: Retrieves the engine installation path from the Windows Registry (only supports Epic Games Launcher versions).
 
* Clean, Build & Launch: Cleans generated folders and files, regenerates solution files, and builds the project. Once complete, optionally launches the project.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Place the UE_CleanBuildLaunch.bat script in the root directory of your Unreal Engine project (the same directory as your .uproject file).

2. Execution:

   * Double-click the UE_CleanBuildLaunch.bat file, or

   * Run it via the command line.

## üìù Notes

* Customization: You can modify the lists of folders and files to delete by editing the corresponding variables in the script:

        `set "FOLDERS_TO_DELETE=Binaries Intermediate Build DerivedDataCache Saved .vs .idea"`
        
        `set "PLUGIN_FOLDERS_TO_DELETE=Binaries Intermediate"`
        
        `set "FILES_TO_DELETE=*.sln *.vsconfig"`


* Engine Path Detection: The script attempts to locate the Unreal Engine installation directory based on the EngineAssociation specified in the .uproject file. Ensure that the engine version is correctly installed and registered.
